# Seo-Refractor

Homework 1

## Description

This project is a refractor type project in which I was given source code and had to fix issues with the code. Some examples include proper naming convention, changing non-semantic to semantic tags, change ordering, change title and restructure class and ids. The purpose of this project is so that I learn proper convention in the future when I develop webpages on my own I understand how to make the code easily readable to me and other programmmers.

## Installation

To install the start code you must clone the Columbia University GitLab repository through your terminal. Next, you have to copy the starter code from the 02-challenge section under the 01-HTML-Git-CSS directory and paste it into your own personal directory. Then you have to git init within the directory which will turn your files into a github repo. Finally, you must go online to github.com under the settings tab in the posted repo and launch the website on github pages. The current website is live at https://rossgilman.com/seo-refractor/.

## Usage

This program is a basic outline for a Social Media Company. It uses general webpage features such as a navbar, images, sections for paragraphs, a title, header and footer. It is used as an outline for future projects so that I know general coding conventions.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
